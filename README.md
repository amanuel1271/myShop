# Design
 
- This app uses the MVC design pattern
- It uses Express js and other libraries to navigate between the frontend and handling the routes. I used EJS(Templating engine) and CSS for the frontend.
- Mongoose ODM is used to connect and access the MongoDB database, which stores user info, product info and also session info.
- The app uses sessions, authentication and validation to handle users.
- It uses stripe to make online payment, the following are available test cards for online payment
- Products are displayed in the shop via a responsive pagination and deleted by users through asynchronous requests and DOM manipulation.
- Invoices for users' orders are generated by PDFKit library
